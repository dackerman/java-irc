# Java IRC Client from scratch

I'm building a Java IRC client from scratch and creating videos as I go. I
learn really well by seeing examples, and following along with people that
have more experience than I do, and I am sure there are others out there
that are the same.

This problem is inspired by the [/r/dailyprogramming](https://reddit.com/r/dailyprogramming)
subreddit, which has this particular problem listed right now, with everyone
following along. If you'd like to do this yourself, I recommend going to
[challenge 258](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/4ad23z/20160314_challenge_258_easy_irc_making_a/)
and getting started there.

I am uploading the videos of this as I create the code on Youtube - you can
see them listed below:

1. [[tag:connecting]](https://github.com/dackerman/java-irc/tree/connecting) [[youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us_1xPgwLz0) IRC: Making a connection

If you were helped by this repo, or have suggestions on how I can make the
videos or repo better, let me know on twitter at
[@dackerman](https://twitter.com/dackerman), or like/comment on the videos!

### Running

I recommend using Intellij to run this, since it's so easy. If you don't have
it, the community edition [can be downloaded for free](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).

1. clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:dackerman/java-irc`
1. open intellij and import the project
1. let it build (happens automatically)
1. right-click on the `com.dacklabs.irc.IrcMain` class and click `Run`
1. Enjoy!
